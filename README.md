# GUVI-LLM-GUVI-GPT-Model-using-Hugging-Face

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the deployment of a GUVI GPT model using Hugging Face. The goal is to provide a seamless experience in interacting with the model through a web interface using Streamlit or Gradio.

## Objectives

- Deploy a GUVI GPT model using Hugging Face.
- Gain skills in deep learning, transformers, Hugging Face models, LLM (Large Language Models), 
  and deployment using Streamlit or Gradio.

## Skills to Acquire

- **Deep Learning:** Understanding and applying neural networks and training models.
- **Transformers:** Utilizing transformer architecture for NLP tasks.
- **Hugging Face Models:** Working with pre-trained models and fine-tuning them.
- **LLM (Large Language Models):** Handling large-scale models for complex tasks.
- **Deployment:** Creating and deploying interactive web applications using Streamlit or Gradio.

## Steps

1. **Setup Environment:**
    - Install necessary libraries: transformers, torch, streamlit or gradio, etc.
    - Set up a virtual environment for your project.
2. **Load and Fine-Tune Model:**
    - Choose a pre-trained model from Hugging Face.
    - Fine-tune the model on a specific dataset if required.
3. **Build Interactive Interface:**
    - Create a user-friendly interface using Streamlit or Gradio.
    - Integrate the fine-tuned model into the interface for real-time interaction.
4. **Deploy Application:**
    - Deploy the application on a cloud platform (Heroku, AWS, etc.).
    - Ensure the application is accessible and scalable.
5. **Document the process:**
    - Write a detailed README file.
    - Include code snippets, explanations, and usage instructions.
  
## Using the Application

1. **Streamlit:**
    - Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501.
    - Interact with the GUVI GPT model through the provided interface.
2. **Gradio:**
    - Open your browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal.
    - Use the interface to generate text and interact with the model.
  
## Deployment

- **Heroku:**
   - Create a new application on Heroku.
   - Connect your GitHub repository.
   - Enable automatic deployment from the main branch.
   - Add buildpacks for Python.
 
- **AWS:**
   - Set up an EC2 instance.
   - Install required dependencies.
   - Run the application and ensure it is accessible.
